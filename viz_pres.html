# Communicating with data visualization
### Camille Seaberry, DataHaven
### March 15, 2018

# Goal of this workshop

.font110[Data visualization is way too big a field to cover in one morning! But these are some starting places for improving your use of data visualization.

I'm not a data viz genius, so probably any of the charts I've made here could be improved upon.]

# What is data visualization?

.font110[
&gt; *The representation and presentation of data to facilitate understanding*
&gt;
&gt; -- Andy Kirk, "Data Visualisation: A Handbook for Data Driven Design"

&gt; *Data graphics visually display measured quantities by means of the combined use of points, lines, a coordinate system, numbers, symbols, words, shading, and color*
&gt;
&gt; -- Edward Tufte, godfather of data visualization, "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information"

# Maybe you don't need a visualization

Chart serves *some* purpose, but you might be better off with just text:




* Working men's median income is $51,367, compared to women's median income of $35,681
* On average, working men out-earn working women by $15,686 each year
* On average, women earn 69 cents on the male dollar

]

# Maybe you don't need a visualization

.pull-left[
* A few overview stats---especially if comparisons wouldn't be appropriate

.pull-right[
* Bullet points

# Questions to ask yourself

.font120[
If you *do* need a visualization, be intentional about what you create

What's your purpose?

* Comparing two or more observations
* Comparing values changing over time
* Showing parts of a whole
* Finding relationships between values
* Placing numbers on a map
* Distributions of values
  ]
  
---
  
# Purpose

## Comparing observations

&lt;img src="viz_pres_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="672" /&gt;

---

# Purpose

## Parts of a whole

&lt;img src="viz_pres_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="672" /&gt;

---

# Questions to ask yourself

.font120[
* Who's your audience?
  + Make charts for yourself to understand your data as well
* What's the purpose?
* What do you need to communicate? What's the takeaway?
* What can you do without?
]

---

# Focusing on your audience

Example: boxplots

Statisticians: üòç. General audience: ü§î



&lt;img src="viz_pres_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="672" /&gt;

---

# Focusing on your audience

General audiences often more concerned with averages or summary figures, not distributions.

Or pair a simple chart with more detailed text like "Low-income rates vary greatly throughout Greater New Haven's census tracts, with rates in some tracts in the single digits, while many city tracts have rates over 50%."

&lt;img src="viz_pres_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="672" /&gt;



---

# What's the purpose?

Hard to read, and unclear what the purpose is

&lt;img src="viz_pres_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" width="672" /&gt;

---

# What's the purpose?

Purpose: show differences in income between towns

&lt;img src="viz_pres_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" width="672" /&gt;

---

# What's the purpose?

Purpose: to show income by gender in each town

&lt;img src="viz_pres_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png" width="672" /&gt;

Alternatively, could order by largest pay gap

# Basic guidelines

.font120[
* Figure out what you're trying to show, and why
* Use an appropriate chart/visualization type
* Map ink to values
* Get rid of junk and distractions

# Bad habits

.font120[
* Muddying your data
* Telling inaccurate stories
* Visual cues that are flashy but contribute nothing/interfere with understanding (see any cable news channel)
* Unexamined use of pie chart, 3D, shadows, etc
* Encoding information that isn't actually there---e.g. do you actually need all those colors?
* Comparing things that are not actually comparable
]

# Bad habits

## Data mud

&lt;img src="viz_pres_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png" width="672" /&gt;

---

# Bad habits

## Fox News-ing your data

![fox news](Fox-News-bar-chart-1.jpeg)

---

# Bad habits

## 3D

If you aren't solving differential equations or plotting terrain, you probably don't need 3 dimensions.

Where should you be reading values?

&lt;img src="3d_bars.png" width="480" height="70%" /&gt;


---

# Bad habits

## Pie charts

Google "pie charts are evil." There's almost always a better way.

&lt;img src="viz_pres_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png" width="960" /&gt;

---

# Bad habits

## Pie charts

Stacked bars are easier to compare between observations

&lt;img src="viz_pres_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png" width="672" /&gt;

---

# Bad habits

## Visualizing information that isn't actually there

&lt;img src="viz_pres_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png" width="672" /&gt;

# Few notes on visual perception

.font120[
Visual perception is a huge field of psychological study. A few basic ideas:

* It might be hard to show minute differences---but it also might not be necessary
* Ink to value---e.g. scale bubbles to area, not diameter
* Colors convey meaning
  + Cultural significance, emotion, politics
  + Color scales might imply direction
]

---

# Few notes on visual perception

Can you spot difference between tract with 20% rate and 25% rate? Is it really necessary?

&lt;img src="viz_pres_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png" width="768" /&gt;

How would you compare poverty rates between non-adjacent parts of the region?

---

# Few notes on visual perception

Putting values into buckets makes it easier to spot patterns &amp; differences---might sacrifice detail but gain clarity

&lt;img src="viz_pres_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png" width="672" /&gt;

Now how easy is it to compare different areas?

# Few notes on visual perception

What do these colors signify?

# Few notes on visual perception

Do these colors tell the story of *change* more accurately? What meaning do we give to these colors?

Red = positive values, but negative outcome (e.g. increase in low-income rate)

# Activities!

## Find what doesn't work

.font130[
In groups, visit WTF Viz [viz.wtf](http://viz.wtf/). Find your group's favorite example of what not to do, and discuss:

* What went wrong?
* What is the visualization's purpose? Or is the purpose not even clear?
* How could you achieve this purpose differently?

# Activities!

## Improve a visualization
